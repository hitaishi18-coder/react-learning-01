⚛️ React State Management App
An interactive React app using useState to demonstrate real-time state updates, including a dynamic fruit name change and counter functionality.

🧠 About the Project
This project introduces the concept of React state using the useState hook. It compares non-state variables to stateful ones, showing how UI automatically reflects state changes, while normal variables do not trigger re-renders.

✨ Features
🍎 Fruit name state management with a button
🔢 Counter and reverse counter using individual state variables
🧠 React hooks (useState) for dynamic UI updates
🧪 Simple example contrasting state vs. plain variables
